# Bitcoin/ Coinbase Arbitrage Opportunities 

This repo applies three phases of financial analysis to determine if any arbitrage opportunities exist for Bitcoin.

Our three phases of analysis will be:

1) Collect the data
2) Prepare the data
3) Analyze the data

* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) - For DataFrames

```
   python
   pip install pandas
   pip install Path
   pip install matplotlib
   
```

## Usage

To use the arbitrage opportunity application, simply clone the repository and create a new_folder to save your **crypto_arbitrage.ipynb** . Navigate to that folder within your terminal, and type the following :

```new_folder
   jupyter lab 
```

Upon launching the arbitrage opportunity application, you will be able to view an overlay plot that visualizes both the Bitcoin + Coinbase graphs over a one-day period. This one-day period will be recorded at the beginning, middle and end of the dataset.
